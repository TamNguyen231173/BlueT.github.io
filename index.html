        <!--Introduce!-->
        <p><strong>Inspirational quotes have an amazing ability to motivate others and change the way we feel about ourselves. This is why I find them so interesting and crucial on our paths to success.</strong><br>
            You can decide what you are going to think in any given situation. Your thoughts and feelings determine your actions and determine the results you get. It all starts with your thoughts – and I have found that inspirational words are a quick way to retune your thinking.

        <p><strong>1.An instinct is just that:</strong>. a hunch, an impression, by definition lacking in concrete evidence. It seems unfair to rely on something so indistinct when making important decisions.<br>
<strong>2.We inherently mistrust ideas without evidence to support them.</strong> We want to be right when making important decisions and we're best able to convince ourselves of our rightness when we can trace our argument from beginning to end without interruption and with a clear understanding of every step.<br>
<strong>3.We're easily swayed by the opinions of others that contradict our instincts,</strong> especially if concrete evidence exists to contradict it. This, even knowing as most of us do that facts and figures about past performance are often flawed indicators of future performance</p>

     <p><strong>1. Cost effective</strong><br>
         <strong>The best way of growing your business is to cut the expenses and focus</strong> solely towards the growth. The website is the best method of cutting the expenses of the business.<br>
         <strong>2. Convenient</strong><br>
         <strong>Everyone is so busy in their lives</strong> that they are finding the convenient ways in every domain of their life. Instead of going to markets, the online shopping is the most convenient method of buying the items.<br>
         <strong>3. Accessibility</strong><br>
         <strong>Even if your business has a big office in the most famous place,</strong> it doesn’t guarantee the success because that place is only accessible for some handful of people.<br>
         <strong>4. More marketing</strong><br>
         <strong>The marketing of your website is easier and cost effective than the marketing</strong> being done for a conventional brick and mortar business. You can either do SEO or SEM for the promotion of your website.<br>
         <strong>5. Increasing credibility</strong><br>
         <strong>Nowadays the website increases the credibility of your business.</strong> The website can also result in the brand awareness about your site. It also plays the role of branding for your site.<br>
         <strong>6. Real-time information</strong><br>
         <strong>If you want to make your customers aware of your offers or sales,</strong> then you have to display some boards or other things. But that is not the case in websites.<br>
         <strong>7. Better customer service</strong><br>
         <strong>If you sell a product</strong> and want to tell the benefits of the product to the customer, then you can upload the articles about it on your website and give better customer service to you customers.<br>
         <strong>8. Lifelong benefit</strong><br>
         <strong>The website keeps giving you the lifelong results.</strong> It means that when you advertise on any board you get only a limited time period of advertisement on it.
